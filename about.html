I designed, built, and managed the company’s website, transforming it from a simple digital business card into a customer-friendly platform for direct communication. I also redesigned the corporate identity (CI) for stronger brand recognition. In addition, I optimized the website’s SEO, managed the company’s social media channels, and created engaging social media content and visuals to boost online presence and customer engagement.

                            <p>In 2021, I completed a 4 months long comprehensive training in Graphic Design, including introductory courses in Adobe Photoshop and InDesign, through Master Training. This program gave me a strong foundation in graphic design theories and hands-on experience with key tools, particularly Photoshop and InDesign. I also gained valuable insights into Adobe's broader suite of creative tools, expanding my understanding of how they can be used to create cohesive and visually engaging designs.</p>

                            <p>From 2015 to 2020, I studied Business Administration with a focus on Marketing and E-Commerce at Hochschule Bremerhaven (University of Applied Sciences). During my studies, I covered core subjects like accounting, controlling, human resource management, and law & taxation. In marketing, I explored more specialized areas such as international and strategic marketing, CRM, e-commerce, and business process modeling.</p>
                            <p>For my bachelor’s thesis, titled In-Game Advertising in Germany, I conducted a comparative analysis of in-game advertising versus product placements in other media, with a particular focus on legal frameworks relevant at the time. This project gave me valuable insights into advertising trends and regulatory impacts across digital and traditional media.</p>
